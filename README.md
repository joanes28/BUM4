# BUM4
To do this 4th Bummer I've firstly copied what in egela was. Then, based in previous labs, I created an fxml file to do the user interface. Once created the fxml, 
I just had to initialize with the data to later add the next and previous buttons action events. I had some problems with the indexes of the list, so I decided to create
an attribute to control the index. For the svg images, I used a piece of code posted in telegram to avoid errors, so when the image url contained .svg I used that 
code. There was an error in an image of "copa libertadores" and I just put in spite of ex.printstackTrace a message to be more "elegant".
